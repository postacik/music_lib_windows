# music_lib_windows

A Flutter package to list midi devices attached to Windows and listen to midi in events from any of the attached devices.

flutter_midi_command (https://github.com/InvisibleWrench/FlutterMidiCommand) package supports only Android, iOS and MacOS so I created this package to use in Flutter Windows applications.

The code in the library was copied from win32_midi (https://github.com/ghost23/win32_midi) project and refined for multiple subscriptions.

An example application can be found in the example folder.
